                                <dd>Ultrasonic Machining (USM) is a non-traditional process, in which abrasives contained in a slurry are driven against the work by a tool oscillating at an amplitude of 25-100 pm and high frequency of 15-30 kHz.</dd>
                              <dt> <b>(B)	Process Principle</b></dt>
                                <dd>Ultrasonic machining is a mechanical type non-traditional machining process. It is employed to machine hard and brittle materials (both electrically conductive and non-conductive material) having hardness usually greater than 40 HRC. The process was first developed in 1950s and was originally used for finishing EDM surfaces.
                                  <br>
                                  In ultrasonic machining, tool of desired shape vibrates at ultrasonic frequency (19 to 25 kHz.) with an amplitude of 15-50 Microns over work piece. Generally, tool is pressed down with a feed force F. Between the tool and work, machining zone is flooded with hard abrasive particles generally in the form of water based slurry. As the tool vibrates over the work piece, abrasive particles acts as indenter and indent both work and tool material. Abrasive particles, as they indent, the work material would remove the material from both tool and work piece. In Ultrasonic machining material removal is due to crack initiation, propagation and brittle fracture of material. USM is used for machining hard and brittle materials, which are poor conductors of electricity and thus cannot be processed by Electrochemical machining (ECM) or Electro discharge machining (EDM). The tool in USM is made to vibrate with high frequency on to the work surface in the midst of the flowing slurry. The main reason for using ultrasonic frequency is to provide better performance.

                                  This solid state variable output power supply with internal or external power control, that converts 50/60 Hz electrical power into 20 kHz electrical power by the help of a electrostrictive transducer. The power supply is designed for continuous duty industrial operation. For optimum efficiency it is equipped with automatic frequency control and automatic load compensation providing constant output amplitude at desired setting to meet the different energy requirement encountered duriing the operation cycle. The power supply incorporates and overload monitor to protect the system form conditions that could normally result in failure if an overload condition occurs.
                                <br>
                                  <b>2. Transducer/converter </b><br>
                                  The 20 kHz electrical energy from the power supply is applied to the transducer element, which transforms the high frequency electrical oscillation into high frequency mechanical vibration. The heart of the converter is a Lead Zirconate Titanate electrostrictive element which when subjected to an alternating voltage, expand and contract at the frequency of the voltage. This electrostrictive converter is highly efficient and the degree of energy conversion is 96%.<br>
                                <b>  3. Sonotrode/Hom </b><br>
                                  The purpose of the horn is to transfer the ultrasonic vibration from the converter to the tool. Material for horn should have good acoustical properties. Titanium and aluminum horns are considered the best material for the fabrication of horns. Horns are also made of Brass, Steel and Monet. These horns are generally used for tools that are over 1" (25.4mm) in diameter.
                                <br>
                                <b>  4. Tool tip </b><br>
                                  Tips attach to titanium horns and are available in a range or head thickness in order to maintain weight relationships with the horn for varying weights and lengths of tools. This allows the horn/tip/tool to operate at optimum frequency. Generally, tools are made of the materials like brass, stainless stee", mild steel or titanium so that Tool wear rate (TWR) can be minimized. The value of ratio of TWR and MRR depends on kind of abrasive, work material and tool materials.<br>
                                  <b>5. Abrasive feed system</b><br>
                                  Recirculating system with container and pump assembly with agitation jets helps to keep the pump grit in suspension. The slurry used in ultrasonic machining process is a mixture of abrasive grains and a liquid media mainly water, kerosene, benzene, glycerol or thin oil. The ratio of abrasives to liquid can vary from 1:4 to 1:1 (by weight). Slurry can be fed externally or internally. In the case of external feeding, the slurry is pump fed by several jets covering
                                  the circumference of the tool or by a single jet. The abrasive used for an appliication should
                                  be harder than the material being machined. Otherwise, the usable life time of the abrasive will be reduced.
                                  <dt>  <b>(D)	Operations of Ultrasonic Machining </b> </dt>
                                    <dd>As the tool vibrates with a specific frequency, an abrasive slurry (usually a mixture of abrasive grains and water of definite proportion) is made to flow through the tool work interface. The impact force arising out of vibration of the tool end and the flow of slurry through the work tool interface actually causes thousands of microscopic abrasive grains to remove the work material by abrasion. Material removal from the hard and brittle materials will be the form of sinking, engraving or any other precision shape.</dd>
